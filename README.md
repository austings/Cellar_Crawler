# Cellar_Crawler

This is a java application I made for my 'CS for AP Students' class in the fall of 2014.
It can be run through the command line with Cellar.java as the main class. The program
takes one argument, which is a config.maz file. The config file is a fully editable
text document, in which a user can specify the layout of the Cellar. This makes the game
replayable and personalizable. The game comes with one config.maz file I have made. 

The goal of the game is to find the mystical artifact known only as the Amulet. I made
this game in with contributions from my classmate Tyler Shank.
