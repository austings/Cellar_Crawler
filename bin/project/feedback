What did you learn by doing this assignment?

We learned about different class interaction, and how that has been taken to a
new level with MVC. The success of a code is based on how well developed it has
been keeping data exchange simple and necessary.


What was easy about this assignment?

Making the GUI and the Model were not hard at all. Figuring our how they 
interact with one another was slightly tricky. Once we understood Observable
and Observer, though, it became pretty easy.


What was harder than you originally thought?

Bug testing. There were so many bugs originally we did not even know where
to begin. We tested as much as we could, but without a GUI, we made majority
of our code without realized what worked and what did not.


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

Stress the importance of pre-planning and design. It makes the project so
much easier.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

We would have liked if there were more elements to tell a story in the game.
Of course, its not really related to computer science. However, designing a 
story not only helps us create a solution and solve this problem, but it makes
the solution more interesting as a program.


What other issues would you like to discuss?

If we could know exactly what it is you want us to output to the user, that
would make following the rubric much easier. Much of what we put in the game
log was just us speculating what the user should and should not know.
